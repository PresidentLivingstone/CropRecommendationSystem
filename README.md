# CropRecommendationSystem

### Crop Recommendation System

The **Crop Recommendation System** aims to help farmers and agronomists select the best crop based on environmental and soil conditions. By leveraging machine learning, the system identifies optimal crop choices for specific regions, enhancing crop yield and supporting sustainable agriculture.

### Objective

The objective is to recommend the most suitable crop based on various soil and environmental features. This is achieved by training a machine learning model to classify the ideal crop for a given set of input conditions.

### Approach

#### Data Analysis and Model Building
Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze input features such as soil nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, and rainfall to predict the best crop. This approach involves training a classification model, enabling it to learn patterns in the data and make accurate recommendations for new inputs.

### About the Dataset

The dataset contains 2,200 entries and 8 columns, providing information on key factors influencing crop growth:

1. **N**: Nitrogen content in the soil
2. **P**: Phosphorus content in the soil
3. **K**: Potassium content in the soil
4. **temperature**: Average temperature in the region
5. **humidity**: Humidity levels in the region
6. **ph**: Soil pH level
7. **rainfall**: Annual or seasonal rainfall amount
8. **label**: Target variable; the recommended crop type based on input features

This dataset enables training a machine learning model to predict the ideal crop type for given soil and environmental conditions.
